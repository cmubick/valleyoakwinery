    Our Story
  </h1>
  <p>Valley Oak Winery is named for the majestic oak tree that grew in the front yard of the Ubick farmstead in Clovis. The tree was a volunteer that started 1967 and still stands on Ashlan Avenue across from Clovis East High School. Our Valley Oak logo symbolizes our family legacy, local heritage, and farming traditions.</p>
  <p>The Ubick family has been growing grapes in Fresno County for over 100 years. The first 1916 Ubick farm site is now part of the Fresno State farm school. Since then, our family has farmed wine grapes, raisins, peaches, garlic, watermelons, pumpkins, onions, olives, oat hay, and raised cattle in Clovis, Conejo, Oleander, Caruthers, Fresno, Selma, Lone Star, and Sanger.</p>
  <p>Building on the family tradition of home winemaking, we established Ubick Vineyards in Clovis and released the first commercial vintage in 2008. We quickly became known for producing small lots of exceptional and distinctive red wines. The family added Valley Oak Winery LLC in 2017 to produce and market wines under our Ubick Vineyards and other house labels.</p>
  <p>Valley Oak Winery and tasting room is set to open in 2017 at the new site of the Ubick Vineyards near Sanger, CA. The vineyard was established in 2014 and boasts eight red wine varietals. Growing our own grapes allows us to influence every facet of winegrowing and production. We strive to create wines that are fruit forward and rich in aromas and flavors unique to the vineyard and the vintage year.</p>
